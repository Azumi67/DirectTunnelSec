# DirectTunnelSec
A learning project in which I will improve. This tunnel will be used with IPsec encryption to have a straightforward and direct tunnel. It uses FOB encryption and all addons could be enabled or disabled with command line.
- FOB encryption [ aes 16 24 32 bytes]
- tcp no delay
- buffer size
- ipv4 and ipv6
- good match for ipsec
- later i will work on udp
